## Webhook Configuration

When creating a webhook, specify which events you want to receive:

```json Webhook Config Example
{
  "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
  "event_type_map": {
    "EMAIL_SENT": true,
    "EMAIL_OPENED": true,
    "EMAIL_CLICKED": true,
    "EMAIL_REPLIED": true,
    "EMAIL_BOUNCED": true,
    "EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBED": false
  }
}
```

## Handling Webhooks

### Example Handler (Python/Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    data = request.json
    event = data['event']
    
    if event == 'EMAIL_REPLIED':
        # High priority - lead replied!
        send_slack_notification(
            f"🎉 New reply from {data['lead']['email']}"
        )
        update_crm(data['lead']['email'], status='Engaged')
        
    elif event == 'EMAIL_OPENED':
        # Medium priority - lead is interested
        increment_lead_score(data['lead_id'])
        
    elif event == 'EMAIL_BOUNCED':
        # Clean up - remove from lists
        remove_from_all_campaigns(data['lead']['email'])
    
    return {'status': 'received'}, 200
```

### Example Handler (JavaScript/Express)

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const { event, lead, reply } = req.body;
  
  // Acknowledge receipt immediately
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
  
  // Process asynchronously
  switch(event) {
    case 'EMAIL_REPLIED':
      console.log(`Reply from ${lead.email}: ${reply.body}`);
      // Send to CRM, trigger workflows, etc.
      break;
      
    case 'EMAIL_OPENED':
      console.log(`${lead.email} opened email`);
      // Update lead score
      break;
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Return 200 Quickly**: Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Implement Idempotency**: Use event ID + timestamp to handle duplicate deliveries
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Verify Webhook Source**: Always validate webhooks come from SmartLead's IPs
</Warning>
