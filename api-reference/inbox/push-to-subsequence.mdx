description: "Move a lead to a subsequence (child campaign) for targeted follow-up"
---

<Note>
Branch lead into targeted follow-up sequences based on behavior or interest. Essential for sophisticated campaign logic and personalized nurturing.
</Note>

## Overview

Moves a lead from a parent campaign to a subsequence (child campaign) for specialized follow-up. Enables branching campaign logic based on lead behavior and interests.

**Subsequence Concept:**
- Parent campaign identifies lead interest/behavior
- Lead pushed to specialized subsequence
- Subsequence delivers targeted messaging
- Optional: Stop subsequence if lead replies to parent

**Use Cases:**
1. **Interest-based routing**: Clicked pricing link → Push to "Pricing Discussion" subsequence
2. **Re-engagement**: No reply after 30 days → Push to "Re-engagement" subsequence
3. **Product-specific**: Asked about Feature X → Push to "Feature X Demo" subsequence
4. **Qualification**: High engagement → Push to "Enterprise Sales" subsequence

## Subsequence Workflows

### Interest-Based Routing
```python
# Lead clicked pricing link
if lead_clicked_pricing:
    push_to_subsequence(
        lead_map_id,
        pricing_discussion_subseq_id,
        delay_days=1,
        stop_on_parent_reply=True
    )
```

### Re-engagement Campaign
```python
# No reply after 30 days
if days_since_last_send > 30 and not replied:
    push_to_subsequence(
        lead_map_id,
        reengagement_subseq_id,
        delay_days=0,
        stop_on_parent_reply=True
    )
```
