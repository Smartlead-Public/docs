## Common Workflows

### Daily Reply Check
```python
# Get all replies received today
from datetime import datetime

today_start = datetime.now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0).isoformat() + 'Z'
now = datetime.now().isoformat() + 'Z'

payload = {
    "filters": {
        "emailStatus": "Replied",
        "replyTimeBetween": [today_start, now]
    },
    "sortBy": "REPLY_TIME_DESC"
}
```

### Find Follow-up Opportunities
```python
# Emails opened but not replied in last 3 days
three_days_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=3)).isoformat() + 'Z'

payload = {
    "filters": {
        "emailStatus": ["Opened", "Clicked"],
        "replyTimeBetween": [three_days_ago, now],
        "leadCategories": {
            "unassigned": True  # Not yet categorized
        }
    }
}
```

### Campaign Performance Audit
```python
# Get all campaign activity with engagement metrics
payload = {
    "filters": {
        "campaignId": [12345, 12346],
        "emailStatus": ["Replied", "Opened", "Clicked"]
    },
    "limit": 20
}

response = get_sent_emails(payload)

# Calculate metrics
total = response['total_count']
replied = len([m for m in response['messages'] 
               if m['email_status'] == 'Replied'])
reply_rate = (replied / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0

print(f"Reply rate: {reply_rate:.2f}%")
```

### Team Member Activity
```python
# Track individual team member performance
def get_member_sent_stats(member_id, start_date, end_date):
    payload = {
        "filters": {
            "campaignTeamMemberId": member_id,
            "replyTimeBetween": [start_date, end_date]
        },
        "limit": 20
    }
    
    response = get_sent_emails(payload)
    messages = response.get('messages', [])
    
    return {
        'total_sent': len(messages),
        'replied': len([m for m in messages if m['email_status'] == 'Replied']),
        'opened': len([m for m in messages if m['email_status'] in ['Opened', 'Clicked']])
    }
```

## Filtering Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```python
# Step 1: Get all sent emails in campaign
basic_filter = {"campaignId": 12345}

# Step 2: Add engagement filter
engagement_filter = {
    "campaignId": 12345,
    "emailStatus": ["Replied", "Opened"]
}

# Step 3: Add category filter
interested_filter = {
    "campaignId": 12345,
    "emailStatus": ["Replied", "Opened"],
    "leadCategories": {"categoryIdsIn": [1]}
}
```

### 2. Combine Inclusion and Exclusion
```python
# Get engaged leads, excluding "Do Not Contact"
filters = {
    "emailStatus": ["Replied", "Opened", "Clicked"],
    "leadCategories": {
        "categoryIdsNotIn": [4]  # Exclude Do Not Contact
    }
}
```

### 3. Use Date Ranges Effectively
```python
# Rolling 30-day window
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

filters = {
    "replyTimeBetween": [
        start_date.isoformat() + 'Z',
        end_date.isoformat() + 'Z'
    ]
}
```

### 4. Paginate Large Results
```python
def get_all_sent_emails(filters):
    """Fetch all results across multiple pages"""
    all_messages = []
    offset = 0
    limit = 20
    
    while True:
        payload = {
            "filters": filters,
            "offset": offset,
            "limit": limit
        }
        
        response = get_sent_emails(payload)
        messages = response.get('messages', [])
        
        if not messages:
            break
            
        all_messages.extend(messages)
        offset += limit
        
        # Stop if we've fetched all records
        if offset >= response.get('total_count', 0):
            break
    
    return all_messages
```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Use appropriate limits**: Default of 20 balances speed and data volume
2. **Filter strategically**: More specific filters = faster queries
3. **Avoid very large date ranges**: Break into smaller chunks
4. **Cache results**: Store frequently accessed data client-side
5. **Use specific campaign/account filters**: Reduces query scope

## Email Status Reference

| Status | Meaning | Follow-up Action |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `Accepted` | Email accepted by server | Wait for open/reply |
| `Opened` | Recipient opened email | Consider follow-up |
| `Clicked` | Clicked link in email | High engagement - prioritize |
| `Replied` | Sent a response | Take action immediately |
| `Not Replied` | Opened but no reply | Schedule follow-up |
| `Bounced` | Email failed to deliver | Verify/remove address |
| `Unsubscribed` | Opted out | Do not contact |
