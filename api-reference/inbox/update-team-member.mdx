description: "Assign or reassign a lead to a specific team member"
---

<Note>
Assign leads to team members for personalized follow-up and workload distribution. Essential for team collaboration and performance tracking.
</Note>

## Overview

Assigns a lead to a specific team member. This endpoint enables lead distribution across your team, reassignment between members, and tracking of individual performance.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Load balancing**: Distribute leads evenly across team
- **Expertise matching**: Assign leads based on team member specialization
- **Accountability**: Track which team member is responsible for each lead
- **Performance metrics**: Measure individual team member results

**Common Use Cases**:
- Round-robin lead assignment
- Geographic territory management
- Industry expertise routing
- Workload rebalancing
- Manager reassignment

## Assignment Strategies

### Round-Robin Assignment
```python
team_members = [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
current_index = 0

def assign_next_lead(lead_map_id):
    global current_index
    member_id = team_members[current_index]
    assign_lead_to_member(lead_map_id, member_id)
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(team_members)

# Distribute leads evenly
for lead in new_leads:
    assign_next_lead(lead['campaign_lead_map_id'])
```

### Territory-Based Assignment
```python
territory_map = {
    'US-WEST': 101,
    'US-EAST': 102,
    'EUROPE': 103,
    'ASIA': 104
}

def assign_by_territory(lead_map_id, lead_territory):
    member_id = territory_map.get(lead_territory)
    if member_id:
        assign_lead_to_member(lead_map_id, member_id)
    else:
        print(f"No member assigned for territory: {lead_territory}")
```

### Expertise-Based Routing
```python
expertise_routing = {
    'SaaS': 101,
    'E-commerce': 102,
    'Healthcare': 103,
    'Finance': 104
}

def assign_by_industry(lead_map_id, industry):
    member_id = expertise_routing.get(industry, 101)  # Default to 101
    assign_lead_to_member(lead_map_id, member_id)
```

### Workload Balancing
```python
def get_member_workload(member_id):
    """Get current number of assigned leads"""
    response = requests.post(
        "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/master-inbox/assigned-me",
        params={"api_key": API_KEY},
        json={"filters": {"campaignTeamMemberId": member_id}}
    )
    return response.json().get('total_count', 0)

def assign_to_least_busy(lead_map_id, team_members):
    """Assign to team member with fewest current leads"""
    workloads = {m: get_member_workload(m) for m in team_members}
    least_busy = min(workloads, key=workloads.get)
    assign_lead_to_member(lead_map_id, least_busy)
```

## Bulk Assignment

```python
def bulk_assign_leads(lead_map_ids, team_member_id):
    """Assign multiple leads to the same team member"""
    results = []
    
    for lead_map_id in lead_map_ids:
        try:
            result = assign_lead_to_member(lead_map_id, team_member_id)
            results.append({
                'lead_map_id': lead_map_id,
                'status': 'success',
                'result': result
            })
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({
                'lead_map_id': lead_map_id,
                'status': 'error',
                'error': str(e)
            })
    
    return results

# Assign 10 leads to Jane
new_leads = [2433664091, 2433664092, 2433664093, ...]
bulk_assign_leads(new_leads, 456)
```

## Reassignment Workflows

### Manager Reassignment
```python
def reassign_from_to(from_member_id, to_member_id, filters=None):
    """Reassign all leads from one member to another"""
    # Get all leads assigned to from_member
    payload = {
        "filters": {
            "campaignTeamMemberId": from_member_id
        },
        "limit": 20
    }
    if filters:
        payload["filters"].update(filters)
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/master-inbox/assigned-me",
        params={"api_key": API_KEY},
        json=payload
    )
    
    leads = response.json().get('messages', [])
    
    # Reassign each lead
    for lead in leads:
        assign_lead_to_member(
            lead['campaign_lead_map_id'],
            to_member_id
        )
    
    return len(leads)

# Transfer all of John's hot leads to Jane
count = reassign_from_to(
    from_member_id=123,
    to_member_id=456,
    filters={"leadCategories": {"categoryIdsIn": [1]}}  # Interested only
)
print(f"Reassigned {count} leads")
```

### Vacation Coverage
```python
def setup_vacation_coverage(away_member_id, covering_member_id, start_date, end_date):
    """Temporarily reassign leads during vacation"""
    # Get active leads
    payload = {
        "filters": {
            "campaignTeamMemberId": away_member_id,
            "emailStatus": "Replied"  # Only active conversations
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/master-inbox/assigned-me",
        params={"api_key": API_KEY},
        json=payload
    )
    
    active_leads = response.json().get('messages', [])
    
    # Reassign to covering member
    for lead in active_leads:
        assign_lead_to_member(
            lead['campaign_lead_map_id'],
            covering_member_id
        )
        
        # Add note about temporary reassignment
        create_note(
            lead['campaign_lead_map_id'],
            f"Temporarily assigned to covering member during vacation from {start_date} to {end_date}"
        )
```

## Getting email_lead_map_id

The `email_lead_map_id` is returned as `campaign_lead_map_id` from inbox endpoints:

```json From inbox response
{
  "messages": [{
    "campaign_lead_map_id": "2433664091",  // Use this value
    "lead": {...},
    "assigned_to": {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Team Member Notifications

After assignment, the team member typically receives:
- Email notification of new assignment
- In-app notification
- Addition to their "Assigned to Me" inbox view

Configure notification preferences in team settings.

## Best Practices

1. **Document assignment logic**: Keep records of why leads were assigned
2. **Add notes on assignment**: Use create-note endpoint to explain context
3. **Monitor workload distribution**: Regularly check assignment balance
4. **Set up SLAs**: Define expected response times for assigned leads
5. **Review periodically**: Reassess assignments based on performance
6. **Handle edge cases**: Plan for invalid IDs, missing members, etc.

## Performance Tracking

```python
def get_member_performance(member_id, start_date, end_date):
    """Get performance metrics for assigned leads"""
    payload = {
        "filters": {
            "campaignTeamMemberId": member_id,
            "replyTimeBetween": [start_date, end_date]
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/master-inbox/assigned-me",
        params={"api_key": API_KEY},
        json=payload
    )
    
    messages = response.json().get('messages', [])
    
    # Calculate metrics
    total = len(messages)
    replied = len([m for m in messages if m['email_status'] == 'Replied'])
    interested = len([m for m in messages 
                      if m.get('category', {}).get('id') == 1])
    
    return {
        'member_id': member_id,
        'total_assigned': total,
        'reply_rate': (replied / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0,
        'interest_rate': (interested / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0
    }
```
