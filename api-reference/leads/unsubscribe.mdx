## Behavior Notes

<Info>
When a lead is globally unsubscribed:
- The `is_unsubscribed` flag is set to `true` on the lead record
- The lead will not receive emails from any campaign
- The lead remains in all campaigns but will not be contacted
- This action affects all current and future campaigns
</Info>

<Tip>
To unsubscribe a lead from a specific campaign only (not globally), use the campaign-specific unsubscribe endpoint: `POST /api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads/{lead_id}/unsubscribe`
</Tip>
