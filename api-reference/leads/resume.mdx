title: "Resume Lead"
api: "POST https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads/{lead_id}/resume"
description: "Resume email sending for a paused lead with optional custom delay"
---

<Note>
Resuming a lead changes its status to `INPROGRESS` and schedules the next email based on the delay specified. If no delay is provided, the sequence's default delay is used.
</Note>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="campaign_id" type="number" required>
  The campaign ID containing the lead
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lead_id" type="number" required>
  The lead ID to resume
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="string" required>
  Your SmartLead API key
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="resume_lead_with_delay_days" type="number">
  Number of days to wait before sending the next email. If not provided, uses the default delay from the sequence configuration. The next email timestamp is calculated as `last_sent_time + delay_days`.
</ParamField>


<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123/leads/456/resume?api_key=YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resume_lead_with_delay_days": 3}'
```

```python Python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
campaign_id = 123
lead_id = 456

# Resume with custom delay
payload = {
    "resume_lead_with_delay_days": 3
}

response = requests.post(
    f"https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads/{lead_id}/resume",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json=payload
)

result = response.json()
if result.get('ok'):
    print(f"Lead {lead_id} resumed with {payload['resume_lead_with_delay_days']} day delay")

# Or resume with default delay
response = requests.post(
    f"https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads/{lead_id}/resume",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={}
)
```

const campaignId = 123;
const leadId = 456;

// Resume with custom delay
const payload = {
  resume_lead_with_delay_days: 3
};

    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  }

const result = await response.json();
if (result.ok) {

## Behavior Notes

<Info>
When a lead is resumed:
- Lead status changes from `PAUSED` to `INPROGRESS`
- The next sequence is determined automatically
- The `next_timestamp_to_reach` is calculated based on:
  - If `resume_lead_with_delay_days` is provided: `last_sent_time + specified_days`
  - If not provided: Uses the default delay from the sequence configuration
  - If no `last_sent_time` exists: Scheduled immediately (NOW)
- Drafted emails are marked as `DRAFTED` and ready to send
</Info>

<Warning>
You cannot resume a lead that is already on the last sequence of the campaign. Attempting to do so will return an error.
</Warning>
