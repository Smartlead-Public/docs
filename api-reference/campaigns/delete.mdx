## Before Deleting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Export Your Data">
    Export leads, statistics, and any important data before deleting
    
    ```bash
    # Export leads first
    curl "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123/leads-export?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stop the Campaign">
    Some systems require campaigns to be stopped before deletion
    
    ```bash
    # Stop first
    curl -X PATCH "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123/status?api_key=YOUR_KEY" \
      -d '{"status": "STOPPED"}'
    
    # Then delete
    curl -X DELETE "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Archiving Instead">
    If you might need the data later, use ARCHIVED status instead
    
    ```bash
    curl -X PATCH "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123/status?api_key=YOUR_KEY" \
      -d '{"status": "ARCHIVED"}'
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative: Archive Campaign

Instead of deleting, you can archive:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Archive Instead
curl -X PATCH "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/123/status?api_key=YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "ARCHIVED"}'
```

</CodeGroup>

**Benefits of Archiving**:
- ✅ Keeps all data
- ✅ Reversible
- ✅ Can analyze later
- ✅ Hides from active list



## Implementation Details

PERMANENT deletion. Cannot be undone. Exports data before deleting if you need it later.

**Response Format**: object
