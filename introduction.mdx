## API Versions

We offer two API versions:

- **V1 API** (Recommended): `/api/v1/...` - Latest version with all features
- **Legacy API**: `/api/...` - Maintained for backward compatibility

<Note>
  We recommend using V1 API for all new integrations. The V1 API offers better performance, more features, and improved response formats.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://server.smartlead.ai/api
```

For V1 endpoints:

```

## Authentication

SmartLead API uses API keys for authentication. You can generate your API key from your dashboard settings.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://server.smartlead.ai/api/v1/campaigns/?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
