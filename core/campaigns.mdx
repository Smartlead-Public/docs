### Multi-Sequence Campaigns

Create sophisticated email sequences:

```
Day 0:  Initial outreach
Day 3:  First follow-up
Day 7:  Second follow-up
Day 14: Final follow-up
```

### Personalization Variables

Use these in your email templates:

- `{{first_name}}` - Lead's first name
- `{{last_name}}` - Lead's last name
- `{{company_name}}` - Company name
- `{{job_title}}` - Custom field: job title
- Any custom field you define

**Example Email**:
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} is in the {{industry}} space...

Best,
Your Name
```

### Account Rotation

SmartLead automatically rotates between your connected email accounts to:
- Distribute sending load
- Improve deliverability
- Build sender reputation
- Avoid ESP limits

### AI ESP Matching

When enabled, SmartLead intelligently matches leads with appropriate sender accounts based on:
- Lead's email provider
- Account deliverability scores
- Sending patterns
- Historical performance

## Campaign Settings Explained

### Track Settings

Control what gets tracked:

- **Email Opens**: Track when leads open your emails
- **Link Clicks**: Track when leads click links
- **Privacy Mode**: Disable tracking for privacy-focused outreach

### Scheduler Settings

Configure sending times:

```json
{
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "days": [1,2,3,4,5], // Monday-Friday
  "start_hour": "09:00",
  "end_hour": "17:00"
}
```

### Sending Limits

- **Max Leads Per Day**: Daily sending cap
- **Min Time Between Emails**: Delay between consecutive sends
- **Follow-up Percentage**: What % of leads get follow-ups

### Stop Lead Settings

Configure when to stop emailing a lead:

- `REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL`: Stop on any reply
- `OPENED_EMAIL`: Stop after opens
- `CLICKED_LINK`: Stop after link click
- `NEVER`: Complete full sequence

## Best Practices

### Campaign Structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One Clear Goal Per Campaign">
    - Focus each campaign on a specific objective
    - Don't mix different audiences in one campaign
    - Keep messaging consistent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segment Your Audience">
    - Create separate campaigns for different personas
    - Personalize based on industry, role, or company size
    - Use custom fields for deep personalization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test and Iterate">
    - Start with smaller test campaigns
    - Monitor open and reply rates
    - Adjust messaging based on results
    - A/B test subject lines
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Email Sequence Design

1. **First Email (Day 0)**
   - Keep it short and value-focused
   - Clear call-to-action
   - Personalize with custom fields

2. **Follow-up 1 (Day 3-5)**
   - Reference previous email
   - Add additional value
   - Different angle/benefit

3. **Follow-up 2 (Day 7-10)**
   - Case study or social proof
   - Address potential objections
   - Softer CTA

4. **Final Follow-up (Day 14-21)**
   - Permission-based ("Should I stop emailing?")
   - Last chance offer
   - Easy opt-out

### Deliverability Tips

<Tip>
  - Warm up new email accounts before adding to campaigns
  - Keep daily sending under 50 emails per account
  - Rotate multiple accounts
  - Monitor bounce rates
  - Use custom tracking domains
</Tip>

### Good Benchmarks

# 1. Create campaign
campaign_response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/campaigns/new",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={"name": "Q1 2024 Outreach"}
)
campaign_id = campaign_response.json()['campaign']['id']

# 2. Add sequences
sequences_response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/campaigns/{campaign_id}/sequences",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={
        "sequences": [
            {
                "seq_number": 1,
                "subject": "Quick question",
                "email_body": "Hi {{first_name}},...",
                "seq_delay_details": {"delay_in_days": 0}
            }
        ]
    }
)

# 3. Add email accounts
accounts_response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/campaigns/{campaign_id}/email-accounts",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={"email_account_ids": [456, 457]}
)

# 4. Add leads

    f"{BASE_URL}/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={
        "lead_list": [
            {
                "email": "prospect@example.com",
                "first_name": "John",
                "company_name": "Acme Corp"
            }
        ]
    }
)

# 5. Start campaign
start_response = requests.patch(
    f"{BASE_URL}/campaigns/{campaign_id}/status",
    params={"api_key": API_KEY},
    json={"status": "ACTIVE"}

print(f"Campaign {campaign_id} is now ACTIVE!")
```
