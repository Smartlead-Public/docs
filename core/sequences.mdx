## What are Sequences?

Sequences are automated follow-up emails that are sent based on time delays and conditions. A typical sequence might look like:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Email 1 (Day 0)">
    Initial outreach email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Email 2 (Day 3)">
    First follow-up if no reply
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Email 3 (Day 7)">
    Second follow-up if no reply
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Email 4 (Day 14)">
    Final follow-up
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sequence Structure

Each sequence has:

- **Sequence Number**: 1, 2, 3, etc.
- **Subject Line**: Email subject (can use variables)
- **Email Body**: Message content (supports HTML and plain text)
- **Delay**: Days to wait before sending
- **Conditions**: When to send (optional)

## Example Sequence

```json
{
  "seq_number": 1,
  "subject": "Quick question about {{company_name}}",
  "email_body": "Hi {{first_name}},\n\nI noticed {{company_name}} is in the {{industry}} space...",
  "seq_delay_details": {
    "delay_in_days": 0
  }
}
```

## Personalization Variables

Use these in subject and body:

### Standard Fields
- `{{first_name}}` - Lead's first name
- `{{last_name}}` - Lead's last name
- `{{email}}` - Lead's email
- `{{company_name}}` - Company name
- `{{website}}` - Company website
- `{{location}}` - Lead's location

### Custom Fields
Any custom field you add:
- `{{job_title}}`
- `{{industry}}`
- `{{company_size}}`
- `{{pain_point}}`
- Any other custom field

### Usage Example
```
Subject: {{first_name}}, question about {{company_name}}'s {{industry}} strategy

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} is based in {{location}} and works in the {{industry}} space.

As a {{job_title}}, you might be interested in...

Best regards,
Your Name
```

## Sequence Delays

Configure delays between emails:

```json
{
  "seq_delay_details": {
    "delay_in_days": 3
  }
}
```

**Recommended Delays**:
- Email 1 → Email 2: 2-4 days
- Email 2 → Email 3: 3-5 days
- Email 3 → Email 4: 5-7 days
- Email 4 → Email 5: 7-14 days

## Sequence Variants (A/B Testing)

Test multiple versions of the same sequence:

```json
{
  "seq_number": 1,
  "seq_variants": [
    {
      "variant_id": "A",
      "subject": "Quick question",
      "email_body": "Version A...",
      "distribution": 50
    },
    {
      "variant_id": "B",
      "subject": "Thoughts on your process?",
      "email_body": "Version B...",
      "distribution": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

## Stop Conditions

Configure when to stop sending:

- **Reply to Email**: Stop on any reply (recommended)
- **Email Opened**: Stop after they open
- **Link Clicked**: Stop after click
- **Never**: Send full sequence regardless
